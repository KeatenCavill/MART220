    The Ai is obviously more styled compared to the p5.js
Unlike the AI I was limited to simple shapes so doing curves was difficult and thus mine is more jagged and simple.
While the Idea is the same, the outputs are very differnt, the AI used a lot more gentle lines and did hills instead of mountains.
My Sketch is more abstract, while you can get the Idea from looking at it, it might take a bit more to recognize what its trying to show.
The AI was more gentle with its design. compared to me, it techincally has a lot more experince with p5.js then I do and thus know what the better method would be to design something.
