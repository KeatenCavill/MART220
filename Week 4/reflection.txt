I didnt use AI in this project to make any images, That is one of the lines I will not cross with AI. In my opinion, AI can be a very handy tool to help code or teach yo.
But using it to create AI is something that cant replace humans or even help them. It lacks the human essantce that art creates. With that I limit what I use AI for and will always opt out of using it for art
when I can find perfectly fine images online. Using to code in p5.js is fine as this is more of a java script toy then a art creation. That being said I looked online to find images I could use to replace what aspect I wasnt proud of.
